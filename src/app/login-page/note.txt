data binding in angular
-----------------------

ts-component
html-view

1-one way binding

    1.1: component to view
        1.1.1: string interpolation {{}} 
        1.1.2: property binding    [property]="value"

    1.2 view to component

        1.2.1 event binding  (eventName) = "method name()"   
        1.2.2 event binding using $event (eventName) = "methodname($event)" 
        1.2.3 event binding using template rendering variable  #variable


2. Two Way binding

    2.1 ngmodel          [(ngmodel)]="value"
                         FormsModule



Redirection in angular
-----------------------

navigateByUrl -method used to Redirection

router        - class : navigateByUrl is present in this class

AppRoutingModule -module


dependency injection :-

- is used when we need method of one class to be used in another class
- it is used in constructor
- here we should use navigateByUrl class in 


STEPS FOR DEP INJECTION:

    - provide access specifier: public/private
    - give a variable name
    - a class name 
    - eg: private varibleName:Classname



Angular Services :-
-used when there is redundent data
-contents present in this can be accessed by all 

How to create a Services
-created as 2 files, one ts file and one specification file
-since folder is not created, we create an external folder
-open folderand open terminal
-command for creating service 'ng g s service-name'




ANGULAR DIRECTIVES

1. Structural Directives : they are used to handle structured datas(array,object) in view(html) of a component

    -ngFor: can be applied in html to access elements from array ( using for loop)




* Forms can be created in two ways in angular:
    1. Template driven form 
    2. Model Driven form(easy to validate using inbuilt angular methods)
