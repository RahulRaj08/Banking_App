data binding in angular
-----------------------

ts-component
html-view

1-one way binding

    1.1: component to view
        1.1.1: string interpolation {{}} 
        1.1.2: property binding    [property]="value"

    1.2 view to component

        1.2.1 event binding  (eventName) = "method name()"   
        1.2.2 event binding using $event (eventName) = "methodname($event)" 
        1.2.3 event binding using template rendering variable  #variable


2. Two Way binding

    2.1 ngmodel          [(ngmodel)]="value"
                         FormsModule



Redirection in angular
-----------------------

navigateByUrl -method used to Redirection

router        - class : navigateByUrl is present in this class

AppRoutingModule -module


dependency injection :-

- is used when we need method of one class to be used in another class
- it is used in constructor
- here we should use navigateByUrl class in 


STEPS FOR DEP INJECTION:

    - provide access specifier: public/private
    - give a variable name
    - a class name 
    - eg: private varibleName:Classname



Angular Services :-
-used when there is redundent data
-contents present in this can be accessed by all 

How to create a Services
-created as 2 files, one ts file and one specification file
-since folder is not created, we create an external folder
-open folderand open terminal
-command for creating service 'ng g s service-name'




ANGULAR DIRECTIVES  --- They are used to manage DOM in angular

1. Structural Directives : they are used to handle structured datas(array,object) in view(html) of a component

    -ngFor: can be applied in html to access elements from array ( using for loop)

    -ngIf - to apply if condition directly in html

2. Component DIRECTIVES

3.Attribute Directive ----------- To apply Attribute to DOM
    -ngClass

* Forms can be created in two ways in angular:
    1. Template driven form 
    2. Model Driven form(easy to validate using inbuilt angular methods)

            -To create model driven form 'reactive form' technique is used
            -To imply it "ReactiveForms" module is used to create model form   
            -Form builder :- it is a class of ReactiveForms Module
            
            There are # important parts in a model form
                -Group,Array,Control



            -To connect a model to html, use [formGroup]="model name"



            Steps to create model form
                1.Import ReactiveFormsModel
                2. Dep Inject 'FormBuilder' class to respecctive ts file     
                3.Create Model Form: it contains 3 parts(grp,array,control)
                4.link model to html page using formGroup
                5.Connect each data to group using formControlName
                6.Store variable name from array




Validation Model Form
---------------------

class used : Validator(it is an inbuilt class that contains methods for validation) no dep injection needed

methods:
            -required: compulsary required data
            -pattern: is for giving conditions for the field, i.e no of characters, numbers limit etc

- rules are applied in the model forms created

Steps for applying rules    
    - rules are mentioned in the model form created
    - to which variable the corresponding rule is required, it is specified in the array of that variable
    -give class name Validator.'methodRequied'

Rule for regular exp
- [accpeting characters]{limit}
- * implies 0- infinity
- + implies 1-infinity    
- ^ implies not 



how to access each invalidate errors
-----------------------------------

-To access data from each field after validation: this.modelFormName.get('var name of the field')?.errors

        -this will return a valid or invalid data
        -if the data is valid - empty response
        -invalid -content



Local Storage in Angular
---------------------

- store localstorage.setItem()
- access localstorage.getItem()
-delete localstorage.removeItem()


sharing parent component with child 
----------------------------------
- is by using selector given in parent
- [variable]="data to be passed"



How to hide Component
---------------------

1. Take div/form of html comp to be hidden
2. Give a class and make opacity 0 
3. Use Attribute Directive to call class only when needed



Date and Time in Angular
-----------------------

To get date, use Date class and create an object




How to create an userdefined event
---------------------

-It is created by creating an object of EventEmitter class
-After creation, we should emit an event, i.e Start the event



Decorators
- @Input() Parent to child data sharing
- @Output() Child to parent data sharing

- these data can only be shared


Angular pipe
------------

- It is used to transform data from one type to another
- eg: Date pipe


To install node module while cloning: npm i
